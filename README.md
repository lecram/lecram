### Hi there

I write lightweight programs and libraries, mostly using [C](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming/Why_learn_C%3F) and [LuaJIT](https://luajit.org/luajit.html).

Some of my current interests are 2D graphics programming, MIDI sequencers and UNIX tools and HTTP.

Many of my projects are released into the [public domain](http://cr.yp.to/publicdomain.html), so you can use the code freely for any purpose.

I'm in the process of reducing reliance on GitHub. Eventually you'll find my stuff on [lecram.dev.br](lecram.dev.br).
Recent code is already being pushed to [git.lecram.dev.br](git.lecram.dev.br).

Currently I'm unable to work on issues/PRs posted on my GitHub repos, sorry.

There's still some old stuff at [lecram.github.io](lecram.github.io).
