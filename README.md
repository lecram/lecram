### Hi there

I write lightweight programs and libraries, mostly using [C](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming/Why_learn_C%3F).

Some of my current interests are 2D graphics programming, MIDI sequencers and UNIX tools.

Many of my projects are released into the [public domain](http://cr.yp.to/publicdomain.html), so you can use the code freely for any purpose.

You can support my work by testing it, reporting issues or [making a donation](https://liberapay.com/lecram/).
